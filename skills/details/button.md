# Button & Control Details

Hit areas, cursor semantics, click guards, and keyboard shortcuts for buttons and interactive controls.

**Skip when:** The element isn't actually interactive (static labels, decorative chips) — hover cursors and shortcuts there mislead. Single-key shortcuts and contextual cursors only earn their keep in dense, frequently-used tools; on a marketing page or settings form they're noise.

## 1. Make the hit area larger than the visual element

Per Fitts's Law, acquiring a target is faster the bigger it is — so let the button look small and refined while feeling generous and forgiving. Pad the hit area beyond the glyph rather than bloating the glyph itself. Rule of thumb: extend the hit area for any visual smaller than 44px on mobile, 24px on desktop.

## 2. Reserve the pointer cursor for navigation

Default to the arrow cursor everywhere, then opt into `pointer` only where a click takes the user to a new page. The cursor then reliably predicts whether a click navigates or just acts in place.

```css
a {
	cursor: pointer;
} /* goes somewhere */
button {
	cursor: default;
} /* acts in place */
```

## 3. Use a contextual cursor over special targets

Swap to a context-specific cursor when hovering an element with a distinct interaction model — e.g. Linear shows a help cursor over an author/people section so the cursor itself signals "more info here, not a link."

```css
.author-section:hover {
	cursor: help;
}
.user-avatar:hover {
	cursor:
		url("/cursors/avatar.svg") 4 4,
		pointer;
}
```

## 4. Guard against duplicate clicks

Disable the trigger the instant it fires so a rapid double-click or impatient repeat-tap can't submit a second order, message, or API call. Re-enable only after the request resolves.

## 5. Shake a disabled button when it's clicked

A disabled button that simply ignores clicks feels broken. A quick horizontal shake acknowledges the attempt and reads as "not yet" — telling the user the control exists but isn't ready.

```css
@keyframes shake {
	0%,
	100% {
		transform: translateX(0);
	}
	25% {
		transform: translateX(-4px);
	}
	75% {
		transform: translateX(4px);
	}
}
.btn.is-disabled.clicked {
	animation: shake 0.2s ease;
}
```

## 6. Offer single-key shortcuts in power-user tools

In non-compositional, high-frequency views (a dashboard, not a doc editor), bind bare keys without Cmd/Ctrl/Alt — press `F` and the find menu opens instantly. Removing the modifier shaves a micro-decision off every action and rewards mastery. Skip the shortcut when focus is in a text field, where the keypress should compose text.
