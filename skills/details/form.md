# Form Details

Crafting form inputs, keyboards, labels, and data-entry interactions so typing, focusing, and submitting feel effortless.

## 1. Link every label to its input

Wire `<label for="id">` to the input's `id` so clicking the label focuses the control. HTML does this natively — don't break it. It enlarges the hit target and is required for screen-reader association.

```html
<label for="email">Email</label> <input id="email" type="email" />
```

## 2. Make every interaction keyboard-reachable

Every control must be focusable and operable without a pointer: Tab reaches it, Enter/Space activates it, Esc dismisses. Verify by unplugging the mouse and completing the whole form. Custom widgets need `tabindex` and key handlers.

## 3. Respect CJK composition state

Track `compositionstart`/`compositionend` and ignore Enter or single-letter shortcuts while composing. IME methods (Pinyin, Romaji) pre-fill letters and use Enter to confirm a pending candidate — acting on those keydowns submits or filters mid-word for CJK users.

```js
let composing = false;
input.addEventListener("compositionstart", () => (composing = true));
input.addEventListener("compositionend", () => (composing = false));
input.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
	if (e.key === "Enter" && !composing) submit();
});
```

## 4. Make Enter context-aware

Enter should submit in single-line intent and insert a newline inside a code block or multi-line context — Discord sends a message normally but wraps when the caret sits in a markdown code fence. Branch on caret context (and modifier keys) so the same key matches what the user is doing.

```js
function onKeyDown(e) {
	if (e.key === "Enter" && !e.shiftKey && !inCodeBlock()) {
		e.preventDefault();
		send();
	}
}
```

## 5. Pre-fill fields with example content

Seed empty fields with realistic, editable sample values — not just gray placeholder text — because people love to copy. Concrete examples teach the expected format and lower the activation cost of starting.

## 6. Morph the trigger button into the input

When a button reveals an input, animate the button morphing into the field in place rather than opening a dialog. Keeping the control anchored preserves spatial context and avoids modal disorientation.

```css
.field {
	transition:
		width 0.2s ease,
		border-radius 0.2s ease;
}
```

## 7. Accept natural-language dates

Parse phrases like "next Friday" or "in 3 days" alongside the calendar picker. People express dates in relative terms; resolving them to a concrete date is faster than navigating a grid.

```js
import * as chrono from "chrono-node";
const date = chrono.parseDate("next Friday"); // → Date
```

## 8. Auto-convert common character sequences (Need confirm)

Replace typed sequences with their intended glyphs as the user types — `->` becomes `→`, `--` becomes `—` (Notion and Linear both do this). Convert only unambiguous patterns so the editor feels smart without fighting the user.

## 9. Tolerate overflow so people can finish their thought

Don't hard-truncate or block typing at a visual boundary — let the value scroll or wrap past the field's width and let people complete the input before you validate or trim. Cutting them off mid-thought loses content and trust.

## 10. Combine magic-link and password into one login field (Need confirm)

Let a single field accept either an email (for a magic link) or a password, branching on what was entered instead of forcing the user to pick an auth method up front. One field reads as less work than a choice between two flows.
