# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **detail.design skill** — a documentation-only repository containing curated UI design detail guidelines for AI coding assistants. There is no build system, no tests, and no compiled code. All content is Markdown.

Install: `npx skills add detaildotdesign/skill`

## Repository Structure

- `skills/SKILL.md` — Main skill definition with metadata (name, description, license) in YAML frontmatter, plus the core philosophy and usage instructions
- `skills/details/*.md` — 11 category-specific guideline files, each containing numbered rules with examples

## How the Skill System Works

`SKILL.md` is the entry point. It directs the AI assistant to load specific files from `details/` based on what the user is working on (e.g., load `details/form.md` when working on forms). Each detail file is self-contained and follows a consistent format: numbered rules, each with a title, explanation, and often a code example.

## Content Conventions

- Each rule in a detail file is a `###`-level heading with a number prefix (e.g., `### 1. Title`)
- Rules should be **reusable techniques** applicable beyond a single product, **too subtle to notice individually**, or **easter eggs/moments of delight**
- Rules should NOT be core features, onboarding/hero/card design, or pure decoration
- The five core principles: craft over decoration, ambient over obvious, physics over magic, intent over input, consistency over novelty

## When Editing Content

- Keep rules actionable and include code examples where possible (HTML/CSS/JS/React)
- New detail categories need a corresponding entry in the "How to use this skill" section of `SKILL.md`
- Rule numbering is sequential within each file
